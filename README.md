# Project-2-Research-Paper-Abstract-Matcher
This Project is based on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
# Project Description
ðŸš€ Happy to share that Iâ€™ve completed another milestone project!
ðŸ“š "Research Paper Abstract Matcher" â€“ built in two separate Streamlit apps using
ðŸ”¹ TF-IDF
ðŸ”¹ Embedding Techniques (Sentence Transformers)

ðŸ’¾ All research data (titles, summaries, authors, etc.) is stored in MongoDB, accessed via Python (PyMongo) for efficient retrieval and filtering by domain.

ðŸ§  About the project:
The TF-IDF version uses term importance to find keyword-based similarity.
The Embeddings version leverages deep learning models for context-aware semantic matching.
Both apps calculate cosine similarity to rank papers based on abstract relevance.

ðŸ“Œ TF-IDF vs. Embeddings:
TF-IDF is fast and interpretable â€“ great for surface-level matching.
Embeddings understand context â€“ ideal for deeper semantic comparisons.
This project aims to make literature exploration smarter for researchers by matching their abstract with relevant papers from a MongoDB-powered database.

Do You Know ? The same project can be done in multiple ways. Like using RAG Techniques and Vector Data Bases, Using Embedding Techniques, Using Agents for real time data, Using Scikit-learn. Thank You.
